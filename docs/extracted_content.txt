START & SCALE YOUR INFLUENCER
MARKETING AGENCY (IMA)
Step-by-step blueprint for beginners

1. What Is an Influencer Marketing Agency?
An Influencer Marketing Agency (IMA) sits in the middle between:
●​ Brands that want attention, content and sales​
●​ Creators / influencers who already have that attention, but need help monetising it​

You get paid to:
●​ Find the right creators​
●​ Negotiate deals​
●​ Coordinate content & timelines​
●​ Track performance​
●​ Make the campaign smooth and profitable for both sides​

You don’t:
●​ Build or ship products​
●​ Run paid ads (unless you choose to add that later)​
●​ Need a big audience or a big team to start​

Why this model is powerful now:

●​ Brands are shifting budget from traditional ads → creators & UGC​
●​ Influencer-backed brands are beating big legacy brands​
●​ Even “normal” companies (software, travel, wellness, fashion, etc.) now need influencer
marketing in their mix​

2. Choose Your Offer (How You Make Money)
Start simple. You don’t need to offer everything on day one.

Core Service Models
1.​ One-Time Collaborations (Beginner-friendly)​
○​ You connect one brand + one influencer for a specific deliverable​
○​ Example: 1x TikTok + 3x story frames​
○​ You charge: 20–30% of the deal size (from brand, from creator, or both)​
2.​ Influencer Seeding (Beginner-friendly)​
○​ Brand sends free product to many micro / nano influencers​
○​ No fixed fee to creators – in exchange for potential content​
○​ You charge: a flat campaign fee (e.g. $1.5K–$5K+) or monthly retainer​
3.​ Talent Management (Intermediate)​
○​ You represent the creator and manage all their brand deals​
○​ You charge: 15–25% of each brand deal​
4.​ Full Campaign Management (Advanced / High-ticket)​
○​ You handle strategy, sourcing, negotiations, tracking & reporting​
○​ You charge: 15–40% of total campaign budget or a big fixed fee​

What You Should Start With
For your first 1–3 months:

✅
✅

Start with:​
One-time collaborations​
Influencer seeding
These:
●​ Are easier to sell​
●​ Don’t require case studies​
●​ Help you learn fast and build proof​

Once you have some wins:
●​ Upsell talent management to creators you brought deals to​
●​ Upsell full campaign management to brands that liked your first test​

3. Pick One Niche (And Stick to It)
If you chase every industry, you stay a beginner forever.

Good niches for IMA work
Examples:
●​ Beauty / skincare​
●​ Wellness / supplements​
●​ Fitness (apps, apparel, gear)​
●​ Tech tools & apps (AI tools, productivity apps, SaaS)​
●​ Fashion (streetwear, sustainable, loungewear)​

●​ Travel & experiences​
●​ Pet products​
●​ Digital education (courses, memberships, apps)​

Filters for choosing your niche
Ask yourself:
1.​ Do I actually like this space?​
You’ll be talking to these brands & creators daily. It helps if you care.​
2.​ Can creators easily show the product on camera?​
Physical products and consumer-facing apps work great.​
3.​ Do brands in this niche already use influencers?​
You want markets where creator marketing is normal, not something you have to “convince”
them to try.​
4.​ Is there room to grow?​
You want niches where brands work with creators every month, not just on random launches.​
5.​ Can I go deeper into sub-niches later?​
Example:​
○​ Fitness → women’s home workouts → gym gear → supplements​
○​ Tech → AI tools → Chrome extensions → creator tools​

Rule: Pick one niche and commit at least 3–6 months before switching.

4. Set Up Your Basic Foundations
You don’t need a fancy brand to start — just look legit.
●​ Agency name (simple is fine)​
●​ Domain + professional email​

○​ Not: influenceroutreach@gmail.com​
○​ Yes: hello@youragency.com​
●​ Simple one-page site or Notion page (optional but nice)​
○​ Who you help​
○​ What you do​
○​ How to contact / book a call​

This alone puts you ahead of 90% of “DM only” people.

5. Build Your Creator Roster (Supply Side)
You don’t need hundreds of influencers to start — you just need a curated list in one niche.

Where to find creators
●​ TikTok search (hashtags + niche keywords)​
●​ Instagram search + hashtags + tagged posts of niche brands​
●​ YouTube (reviews, tutorials, unboxings in your niche)​

What to check before adding them
●​ Average views (look at last 10–15 posts)​
●​ Engagement (2–5%+ is healthy)​
●​ Content quality (would a brand be proud to repost this?)​
●​ Audience fit (do their followers look like your target buyers?)​

How to organise your roster

Use a simple Google Sheet / Notion:
●​ Name​
●​ Handle + platform​
●​ Niche​
●​ Followers​
●​ Average views​
●​ Country​
●​ Email​
●​ Notes (rates, style, good for X type of brand, etc.)​

Your roster is an asset. Every creator you vet properly makes you more valuable to brands.

6. Find & Qualify Brands (Demand Side)
You want brands that:
●​ Already spend on marketing​
●​ Already understand influencer / UGC​
●​ Have clear offers & products (not vague “vibe” brands only)​

Where to find them
●​ YouTube sponsor scraping​
○​ Search creators in your niche → see who’s sponsoring their videos​
●​ Instagram & TikTok​
○​ Brands with strong content & creator reposts​

○​ Brands sending PR / collabs already​
●​ Product Hunt / App stores (for tools & apps)​
●​ LinkedIn​
○​ Search: Head of Marketing, Influencer Marketing Manager, Growth, Brand Manager in
your niche​

What kind of brands to target first
When you’re starting out, aim for:
●​ VC-backed or fast-growing DTC brands​
●​ 5–50 employees range​
●​ Already running:​
○​ Meta ads / TikTok ads​
○​ PR / influencer gifting / UGC​

They’re:
●​ Big enough to have budget​
●​ Small enough to move fast and take a chance on you​

Track them in a sheet:
●​ Brand​
●​ Website​
●​ Niche​
●​ Contact person​
●​ Email​

●​ Have they used influencers before? (Y/N)​
●​ Last contact date​
●​ Status (Not contacted / Contacted / Call booked / Won / Lost)​

7. Outreach That Actually Gets Replies
1) Email setup
●​ Use your custom domain email​
●​ Keep your email signature simple & clean​
●​ Warm up by sending some normal emails before mass outreach​

2) Outreach to brands (simple template)
Keep it short and human.
Subject: Quick idea for [Brand] influencers
Hi [Name],
I’ve been following [Brand] and noticed you’re already doing [UGC / ads / PR boxes / X].
I run a small influencer/UGC agency focused on [niche].
I’ve been building a vetted list of creators in [niche] who:​
– Match your target audience​
– Create content that works well on TikTok/Reels​
– Are open to [gifting / paid collaborations / whitelisting]
If you’d like, I can send over:​
– A few creator examples I’d recommend for [Brand]​
– A simple structure for a test campaign
Where’s best to send that?

Best,​
[Your Name]​
[Agency Name]
Send 30–50 emails per day in your first sprint.

3) Outreach to creators
Hi [Name],
I help creators like you get brand deals in [niche].
I’m currently speaking with a few brands in [niche] and your content stood out — especially
[specific video/post].
Are you open to:​
– Paid collaborations​
– Gifting campaigns​
– Whitelisting (brands running ads from your handle)?
If yes, I’ll keep you in mind for upcoming briefs and reach out with details + rates.
Best,​
[Your Name]
Follow up 2–3 times. Most deals happen after the follow-up.

8. Running a Simple, Effective Campaign
Once a brand says “yes”, don’t wing it. Use a basic structure.

Step 1 – Clarify objectives
Ask the brand:
●​ What’s the main goal?​
○​ Sales?​
○​ Content (UGC) for ads?​
○​ Awareness / reach?​

●​ What’s the budget range?​
●​ What’s the timeline?​

Step 2 – Creator brief
Keep it clear but not controlling:
●​ Brand overview​
●​ Product details​
●​ Key messages / “must say”​
●​ What to avoid (claims, words, topics)​
●​ Deliverables (e.g. 1 TikTok + 3 story frames)​
●​ Deadlines​
●​ Usage rights (can the brand use content in ads? For how long?)​

Step 3 – Tracking & KPIs
Track:
●​ Influencers used​
●​ Content links​
●​ Views / impressions​
●​ Engagement (likes, comments, saves, shares)​
●​ Swipe-ups / link clicks (if available)​
●​ Discount code redemptions​
●​ Cost per view / cost per engagement​
●​ Sales (if tracked)​

You can use the Campaign Recap structure you found:
1.​ Snapshot​
2.​ Performance summary​
3.​ Planned vs actual​
4.​ Best assets & comments​
5.​ Lessons​
6.​ TL;DR – was it a success?​
7.​ Next steps​

Deliver this as a simple PDF/slide deck. This is what makes brands rebook.

9. Contracts & Payments (Basic)
You’re not a lawyer, but you shouldn’t work on “handshake” deals either.

At minimum, get in writing:
●​ Who is involved (brand, you, creator)​
●​ What’s being done (deliverables)​
●​ Deadlines​
●​ Payment terms (how much, when, method)​
●​ Usage rights (who can use the content, where, for how long)​
●​ What happens if:​
○​ Content is late​
○​ Brand doesn’t pay​

○​ Creator doesn’t deliver​

Payment tips
●​ For small brands / new relationships:​
○​ Aim for 50% upfront, 50% after content is posted​
●​ Understand net 15 / net 30​
○​ Net 30 = they pay 30 days after invoice​
●​ Use:​
○​ Wise / PayPal / Stripe / bank transfer​

When money starts getting real (consistent 4-figure+ deals), register a company and start invoicing
properly.

10. Scaling to $10K+/Month
Once you’ve closed a few deals and your process works, you scale by:

1) Doing more of what works
●​ Double down on one niche​
●​ Re-pitch old brands with new creators​
●​ Turn one-off wins into retainers​

2) Systemising
Create simple SOPs (screen recordings + checklists) for:
●​ Finding brands​
●​ Finding influencers​

●​ Outreach sequences​
●​ Brief creation​
●​ Reporting​

Use VAs for:
●​ Lead research​
●​ Influencer sourcing​
●​ Updating sheets​

You focus on:
●​ Strategy​
●​ Sales calls​
●​ Negotiations​
●​ Client relationships​

11. Use Email & a Newsletter to Attract Clients
Email is one of the highest-ROI tools you can bolt onto your agency.

Why build an email list?
●​ You own it (unlike social followers)​
●​ Brands who join are “warmer” than cold leads​
●​ You can turn educational content into inbound leads​

Simple newsletter idea for your IMA

Niche example: “Influencer Growth & UGC Playbook for DTC Founders”
Send 1–3 emails per week with:
●​ Short case studies (“How 1 creator drove 23% of campaign sales”)​
●​ Tactical tips (subject lines like:​
○​ “One change that doubled UGC performance”​
○​ “3 influencer mistakes that kill ROAS”)​
●​ Soft CTA:​
○​ “Hit reply with ‘BRAND’ and I’ll send you a free campaign idea”​
○​ “Want this done for you? Book a call — link in footer”​

Follow the Mosey Money Minute style:
●​ Subject line pattern (e.g. “IMA Minute: [Result] from [Tactic]”)​
●​ Quick quote or tweet-style insight at the top​
●​ One clear tactical idea (under 200 words)​
●​ CTA + P.S.​

Your list becomes:
●​ A pool of warm leads​
●​ A place to sell your services​
●​ A long-term asset if you ever productise what you know​

12. Mindset: Treat It Like a Real Business
This model is:

●​ Simple to understand​
●​ Beginner-friendly​
…but not a get-rich-quick scheme.​

You’ll need:
●​ Hunger – you actually want this to work​
●​ Discipline – sending emails every day, tracking, following up​
●​ Patience – first deal might take 2–4 weeks of consistent outreach​

If you:
●​ Pick one niche​
●​ Pick one primary offer​
●​ Send 30–50 targeted emails a day​
●​ Learn from every reply and every call​

…you will get deals. The people who win are simply the ones who don’t quit after 10 unanswered emails.
